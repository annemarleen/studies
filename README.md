# Building healing spaces in virtual reality (ongoing project)

This is my little workspace-repo to start building VR-experiences that are sweet and soft. It is a learning tool for myself as well as my students, whom I lecture at the University of Applied Science in Amsterdam. I have been teaching 'Immersive Design XR' lessons to students for three years now and have used materials from my background in Architecture and Industrial Design Engineering, Fashion Design and my work at the Faculty of Digital Media and Creative Industries. I feel the need to make some of my own tools in Unity, to use tiny mockups for learning more about virtual space, movement analysis (kinespheres) and interaction techniques in virtual reality.

Virtual Reality is one of the greatest joys in life, it's a great landscape for learning everything there is to know about the human aspect of interfaces and how system technology can provide support for those who want to explore their sensory perception. Currently, I am preparing a research proposal that will explore and hopefully validate a Method for Designing Virtual Reality Healing Interventions, for reducing lonely feelings via interoceptive awareness.
